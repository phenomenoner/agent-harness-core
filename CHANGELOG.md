# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Reworked `README.md` into a public-facing overview (positioning, architecture diagram, CLI family table, FAQ, dual-license section); moved the internal live-validation, topology, full command walkthrough, and capability ledger content verbatim to `docs/agent-harness-operations-handbook.md`, now referenced from `AGENTS.md` as the session entry point.
- Replaced the condensed `LICENSE-APACHE` text with the canonical Apache License 2.0 text so GitHub license detection no longer reports "Other".
- Fixed the placeholder workspace `repository` URL in `Cargo.toml` and added crate `description` metadata.
- Added root `DOC-GUIDELINES.md` documentation writing guideline, linked from the README documentation table and the operations handbook documentation map.
- Isolated OpenRouter Codex config into provider-specific Codex homes and added a readiness failure when the shared default Codex/OAuth home contains stale OpenRouter provider config.
- Treat Codex app-server protocol errors and failed `turn/completed` events as terminal runtime failures instead of successful empty assistant replies.
- Updated builtin harness ops skill, release checklist, operations docs, and feature parity docs so stale guidance review covers docs, skills, and CLI help during future behavior-changing upgrades.
- Updated response UX docs and the builtin harness ops skill for the guarded final-reply tone policy, including removal of stale "before real Telegram/Discord loops exist" channel-run-once guidance.
- Treat known Codex app-server stream disconnect protocol errors (`Reconnecting...`, `stream disconnected before completion`, and `websocket closed by server before response.completed`) as retryable transient failures before dead-lettering, preserving the existing queue/session context across attempts.
- Changed `response.emojiAccentMode` default to `off`, keeping `subtle` as explicit opt-in, and removed the mechanical `◆ Agent` wrapper from successful final Telegram/Discord replies.
- Split progress current-step narration length from short action/error preview length; current-step status now uses a longer default cap while redaction and platform-safe truncation stay in place.
- Route Telegram/Discord ingress through channel identity bindings after allow-list checks, preserving explicit account ids through queue, outbox, delivery receipts, and gateway callbacks.
- Make runtime retry caps and operator fallback hints configurable through `runtimeBackoff` instead of a fixed hard-coded attempt count.

### Added

- Staging roadmap implementation for P0-P7, Track T, Track M, P6, and P7 direct-code paths.
- Fail-closed `harness-config.json` validation integrated into activation, worker dispatch, and Codex runtime planning.
- Runtime retry/dead-letter statuses and receipts for timeout exhaustion.
- Harness log rotation with rotation receipts.
- Runtime queue retry/skip control that preserves terminal-state immutability.
- Supervision evaluator with heartbeat stale detection, restart backoff, crash-loop breaker, and receipts.
- Local `healthz`, trace reconstruction, and metrics reports.
- Deploy canary receipt model with fake-only and optional live canary decisions.
- SQLite queue shadow compare and background task registry.
- Admission control and scoped stop receipts.
- Token efficiency and prompt-reduction gates.
- Task entities, SQLite budget counters, config drift checks, and learning proposal/quarantine receipts.
- Minimal in-process MCP JSON-RPC request handler plus CLI single-request gate.
- ContextPack validation, memory ingest idempotency, and MCP/tool description pinning helpers.
- Repo-local encrypted vault using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 and ChaCha20-Poly1305.
- Security scan helpers for prompt boundary markers and shell allowed-root checks.
- Invariants catalog, schema registry, release checklist, trust-boundary documentation, atomic-write audit, and security policy.
- Operator CLI commands for the new staging gates.
- Harness secret-env handoff for provider-specific app-server child processes.
- Guarded `response.emojiAccentMode` response tone policy with default `off`, opt-in `subtle`, per-agent/channel overrides, and skips for command, status, error, code-heavy, and risk/security replies.
- `channel-identity-check` for platform/account/channel binding smoke checks.
- Harness-validated outbound `deliveryIntent` for provider-native reply references, constructed from captured inbound provider ids rather than model text.
- `cron-scheduler-run-once` and `cron-scheduler-loop`, with scheduler locks, SQLite watermarks, decision receipts, idempotent worker enqueue, status readback, and optional supervisor-plan integration.
- Account-specific Discord gateway selector support through `--discord-account`, matching the existing event and outbox account selectors.
- Schema registry entries and docs for channel identity, delivery intent, and cron scheduler receipts.
