# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Reworked `README.md` into a public-facing overview (positioning, architecture diagram, CLI family table, FAQ, dual-license section); moved the internal live-validation, topology, full command walkthrough, and capability ledger content verbatim to `docs/agent-harness-operations-handbook.md`, now referenced from `AGENTS.md` as the session entry point.
- Replaced the condensed `LICENSE-APACHE` text with the canonical Apache License 2.0 text so GitHub license detection no longer reports "Other".
- Fixed the placeholder workspace `repository` URL in `Cargo.toml` and added crate `description` metadata.
- Added root `DOC-GUIDELINES.md` documentation writing guideline, linked from the README documentation table and the operations handbook documentation map.

### Added

- Staging roadmap implementation for P0-P7, Track T, Track M, P6, and P7 direct-code paths.
- Fail-closed `harness-config.json` validation integrated into activation, worker dispatch, and Codex runtime planning.
- Runtime retry/dead-letter statuses and receipts for timeout exhaustion.
- Harness log rotation with rotation receipts.
- Runtime queue retry/skip control that preserves terminal-state immutability.
- Supervision evaluator with heartbeat stale detection, restart backoff, crash-loop breaker, and receipts.
- Local `healthz`, trace reconstruction, and metrics reports.
- Deploy canary receipt model with fake-only and optional live canary decisions.
- SQLite queue shadow compare and background task registry.
- Admission control and scoped stop receipts.
- Token efficiency and prompt-reduction gates.
- Task entities, SQLite budget counters, config drift checks, and learning proposal/quarantine receipts.
- Minimal in-process MCP JSON-RPC request handler plus CLI single-request gate.
- ContextPack validation, memory ingest idempotency, and MCP/tool description pinning helpers.
- Repo-local encrypted vault using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 and ChaCha20-Poly1305.
- Security scan helpers for prompt boundary markers and shell allowed-root checks.
- Invariants catalog, schema registry, release checklist, trust-boundary documentation, atomic-write audit, and security policy.
- Operator CLI commands for the new staging gates.
